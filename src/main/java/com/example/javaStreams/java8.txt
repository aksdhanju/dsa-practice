Lambda expressions in Java, introduced in Java SE 8.
 It represents the instances of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single
 abstract method). They provide a concise way to express instances of single-method
 interfaces using a block of code.

 LambdaExpression nahi hota to object ka instance hota jaha lambda expression hai
 then class banata, then method banata joki functional interface ka only abstract method tha
 then jo cheez lambda expression ki body mein hai, wahi cheez method ki body mein likhta
 par kyuki ek hi method implement hoga in child class


If we want to represent a group of objects as a single entity then we should go for collection.
But if we want to process objects from the collection then we should go for streams.
