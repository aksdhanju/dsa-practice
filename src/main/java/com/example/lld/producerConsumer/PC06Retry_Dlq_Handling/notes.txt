What's Next? -> Add a retry + DLQ feature if message isn't acknowledged (e.g., simulate crash)?


Would you like to:
Add a retry + DLQ feature if message isn't acknowledged (e.g., simulate crash)?
Persist messages (e.g., using File or MapDB)?
Add multiple consumers per topic (like Kafka partitions)?


Let's now add acknowledgements, and then progressively incorporate more
 advanced features like message persistence, ordered delivery, and
  multi-consumer support per topic.

| Feature                                      | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Acknowledgement Support**               | ✅ Done above                                                       |
| **2. Message Retry or DLQ**                  | If a consumer crashes or doesn't ack in time                       |
| **3. Message Persistence**                   | Store messages in DB / file system (e.g., using H2/LevelDB/File)   |
| **4. Multiple Consumers per Topic**          | Support multiple consumers for same topic (round-robin or all-get) |
| **5. Consumer Offset Tracking**              | Like Kafka — to allow replay or recovery                           |
| **6. At-Least-Once / Exactly-Once Delivery** | Guarantee delivery semantics                                       |
| **7. Web/Client API**                        | Accept messages via HTTP instead of hardcoded producers            |
| **8. Topic Partitions**                      | For scalability                                                    |
| **9. Distributed Brokers**                   | Handle high loads (stretch goal)                                   |
