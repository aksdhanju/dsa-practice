Case B

Now i don't care its synchronous or asynchronous.
But one thing is there. If queue is full, and we produce some value,
 we won't be able to produce anything. In above implementation, we return.
 So if we are producing (5) we loose that information.
Solution of it could be using wait and notify inside while loop.
 But I want to have only 1 main thread. Is it possible or
  I need to create 1 thread for producer and consumer


üîÅ The Problem You Raised
You correctly observed:
If the queue is full, your current implementation discards the value being produced.
You want to block the producer until there‚Äôs space ‚Äî like a real queue should behave.
But you want to do this with only 1 main thread.
ü§î Is it possible with only one thread?
No, it is not possible to simulate a blocking queue behavior using just one thread without busy waiting.

Here‚Äôs why:
When your single thread calls produce(5) and the queue is full:
Ideally, it should pause and wait for some item to be consumed.
But in your design, there‚Äôs no second thread to consume anything while this thread is waiting.
So the system deadlocks (or you‚Äôd need to use a loop to poll repeatedly ‚Äî which is inefficient and not a proper blocking queue).

‚úÖ What‚Äôs the solution?
You must have at least 2 threads:
One thread continuously or occasionally producing.
Another thread continuously or occasionally consuming.
This way, if produce() blocks due to full queue, it will resume when consume() frees up space ‚Äî handled by the other thread.



  | Design           | Threads            | Blocking?     | Queue full handling                             |
  | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | Main thread only | 1                  | ‚ùå No blocking | Producer loses data or busy waits               |
  | Main + Thread    | 2                  | ‚úÖ Yes         | Wait/Notify pattern works properly              |
  | Java built-in    | Internally managed | ‚úÖ Yes         | Use `BlockingQueue` (like `ArrayBlockingQueue`) |
