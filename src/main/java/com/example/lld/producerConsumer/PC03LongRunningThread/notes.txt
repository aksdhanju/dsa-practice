| Feature              | One-Thread-Per-Call                          | Long-Running Threads                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Style**            | Spawn thread per `produce()` or `consume()`  | One thread runs in loop                |
| **Threads**          | Potentially hundreds/thousands (inefficient) | Fixed number (more efficient)          |
| **Use case**         | Simple demos or infrequent events            | High-throughput systems                |
| **Industry-grade**   | ❌ Not ideal                                  | ✅ Recommended                          |
| **Thread lifecycle** | Short-lived                                  | Long-running                           |
| **Thread control**   | Hard to manage, no shutdown                  | Easier control with flags/interruption |

Alternative (Long-Running Thread) Approach:
A more common industry-grade approach is:
Have one or more producer threads running in a loop, producing values continuously or at intervals.
Have one or more consumer threads running in a loop, consuming values continuously.

✅ Which Should You Use?
For real-world production systems, long-running threads are preferred.
Spawning a new thread for every produce/consume event adds unnecessary overhead and does not scale well.
Long-running threads can be managed using:
Thread pools (ExecutorService)
Graceful shutdown using interrupt flags
Retry mechanisms

✅ TL;DR:
Yes, your current design is multi-producer/consumer capable, but inefficient.
Better design: spawn dedicated long-living producer and consumer threads.
That’s the industry best practice, especially under load.


Note: Main2, Consumer2, Producer2 has following features:
Here is the complete long-running producer-consumer implementation using Java, with full best practices:
It uses wait() and notifyAll() for coordination.
It gracefully shuts down using AtomicBoolean flags and proper interrupt() handling.
It runs producer and consumer on separate threads with simulated delays.


Further enhancements:
Long-running threads can be managed using:
Thread pools (ExecutorService)

lets say in interview i was asked to design real time pub sub system and i designed till now.
lets say long running producer and consumer thread with wait notify handling, graceful shutdown and interrupt handling
What future extensions and requirements can be asked by interviewer at this stage?

Now, in an interview, the interviewer might push you further on:

✅ 1. Thread Management Using ExecutorService (Thread Pools)
Instead of starting raw threads:

new Thread(new ProducerWorker(buffer)).start();
Use a thread pool:

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
executor.submit(new ProducerWorker(buffer));
executor.submit(new ConsumerWorker(buffer));
Why?

Controls max thread usage
Reuses threads (efficient resource use)
Supports graceful shutdown with shutdown() and awaitTermination()
Scales to many producers/consumers without manually managing threads
You can implement Runnable or Callable in your producer/consumer classes.

🔮 Interviewer Follow-Up: “What future extensions would you consider?”
Now that you’ve built a functional system, here’s what they may ask next:

⚙️ 2. Scalability
How will you support 1000s of producers and consumers?

✅ Ideas:
Use a thread pool (ExecutorService) per role
Use bounded queues for backpressure
Use Kafka / Redis Streams for distributed pub-sub

⏳ 3. Backpressure and Rate Limiting
What if producers are faster than consumers?
✅ Solutions:
Bounded queues
Reject or drop oldest messages (like LRU)
Use reactive programming model (Reactor, RxJava)

💥 4. Fault Tolerance
What happens if a consumer crashes? Do you lose messages?
✅ Ideas:
Add message acknowledgment
Retry on failure
Use durable queues (disk persistence)

💾 5. Persistence / Durability
Do you want messages to survive process restarts?
✅ Solutions:
Use persistent queues: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or custom disk-backed queues

🧵 6. Multi-topic Support
Can this system handle multiple topics or channels?

✅ Extensions:
Use a Map<String, Queue<Message>> structure per topic
Have topic-based subscribers
Allow clients to subscribe to multiple topics

⚖️ 7. Load Balancing & Partitioning
Can multiple consumers work on the same topic?

✅ Solutions:
Partition messages across consumers
Add a work-stealing mechanism
Use consistent hashing or consumer groups (like Kafka)

🔐 8. Security
Can anyone publish or consume?

✅ Extensions:
Add producer/consumer authentication
Add access control per topic

📈 9. Monitoring and Metrics
How will you know system health?

✅ Add:
Queue size metrics
Producer/consumer throughput
Error rates

🔁 10. Retry / Dead Letter Queue
What if a message always fails to process?

✅ Add:
Retry logic with exponential backoff
Dead-letter queue (store failed messages separately)

Question1:
In this code if i set thread pool size to 5, what it would mean.
would 5 threads be created.
how many of them will be producer thread and how many would be consumer thread?


See Main3
And in each producer thread, producer will be writing elements to queue starting from value = 0 till infinity unless running.set(false);
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
